# 🎓 Student Performance Tracker

A data analysis and machine learning project that explores student exam performance using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. The goal is to understand performance patterns and predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their exam scores.

## 📌 Features

- Loaded and explored real-world dataset with 1000 student records
- Analyzed the effect of gender, parental education, and test preparation on scores
- Visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Created a "Pass/Fail" target based on total score
- Built a Logistic Regression model to predict student results
- Achieved over 95% accuracy on test data
